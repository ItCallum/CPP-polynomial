# CPP_polynomial-
Writing full classes in C++ using stack and heap memory with operator overloading and memory management. 

Implementes a class Cubic to store co-efficients of an instance of a polynomial of degree 3. Store components  on  the  stack.

Implemented member functions and overload operators as appropriate to: 

•return the co-efficient of a given power of x.
•compute the value of the cubic given a value for x.
•overload addition and subtraction operators to allow cubics to be manipulated. 
•Allow multiplication of a cubic by an intor double•Implement == != += and -= operators.
•Overload the input and output operators (>> and <<) appropriately.
